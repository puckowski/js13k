![13K Rock Paper Scissors](https://github.com/puckowski/js13k/blob/master/13K%20Rock%20Paper%20Scissors.png)

Goal is to implement a 3D game that satisfies the following critieria:

All your code and game assets should be smaller than or equal to 13 kilobytes (that's exactly 13,312 bytes, because of 13 x 1024) when zipped. Your .zip package should contain index.html file in the top level folder structure (not a subfolder) and when unzipped should work in the browser. Don't overcomplicate building the zip package, it should unpack on any platform without problems. You can use tools that minify JavaScript source code.
